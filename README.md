### Hello there 👋, I am Mostafa Othman!


I am a highly skilled robotics software engineer from Egypt, keen on developing and deploying emerging robotic systems
for industrial applications. Competent in enhancing and streamlining robot operations, utilizing deep learning and computer
vision techniques to increase efficiency and improve performance. Eager to provide innovative solutions to industry-specific
issues, furthering technological progress in the robotics domain.

Currently working as a Field Application Engineer for deploying multiple robot systems at Rapyuta Robotics,
 - Responsible for delivering the software based on customer requirement definition.
 - Running simulation for performance optimizing and validation tests with customer-specific requirements.
 - Enhance the automation tools for faster and more optmized deployments.
The topic of my master's studies is related to solving robotic manipulator assembly (PegInHole) tasks using Teleoperation, Haptic Feedback, Computer Vision, and Reinforcement Learning.
I have solid experience in operating multiple hardware and manipulators (Kuka iiwa) robots using ROS.
