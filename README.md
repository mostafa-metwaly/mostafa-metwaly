### Hello there 👋, I am Mostafa Othman!


I am a highly skilled robotics software engineer and machine learning enthusiast from Egypt , keen on developing and deploying emerging robotic systems
for industrial applications. Competent in enhancing and streamlining robot operations, utilizing deep learning and computer
vision techniques to increase efficiency and improve performance. Eager to provide innovative solutions to industry-specific
issues, furthering technological progress in the robotics domain.

The topic of my master studies is related to solving robotic assembly (PegInHole) tasks using Teleoperation, Haptic Feedback, Computer Vision and Reinforcement Learning.
I have experiance in operating a Kuka iiwa robot using ROS.
